		My research project concerns the sets pictured below.

		Colored in dark blue is \(\mathcal{M}\) which is the closure of the set of roots in \(\mathbb{D}\) of polynomials with coefficients
		in \(\lbrace-1,0,+1\rbrace\). In magenta is \(\mathcal{M}_0\) which is the closure of the set of roots in \(\mathbb{D}\) of with
		coefficients in \(\lbrace-1,+1\rbrace\), commonly known as Littlewoodâ€™s polynomials. Both are bounded outside by the unit circle,
		and usually depicted in overlap as \(\mathcal{M}_0\subset\mathcal{M}\). Interest in these sets spiked recently after <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7647">G. Tiozzo</a>,
		inspired by a conjecture of <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=3289916">W.P. Thurston</a>, proved that \(\mathcal{M}_0\)
		equals the closure in \(\mathbb{D}\) of the set of Galois conjugates of entropies of superattracting real quadratic polynomials.
		From a different point of view, the set \(\mathcal{M}\) is the connectedness locus of the family of iterated function systems (IFS)
		\( \langle \mathfrak{s}_-(z), \mathfrak{s}_+(z)\rangle=\langle \lambda z-1, \lambda z+1\rangle \) namely the set of parameters \( \lambda \)
		for which the associated limit set of the IFS is connected.
		</p>
		<p>
		The limit set is the unique invariant compact set satisfying \( \mathsf{A}_\lambda=\mathfrak{s}_-(\mathsf{A}_\lambda)\cup\mathfrak{s}_+(\mathsf{A}_\lambda) \).
		Some examples of \( \mathsf{A}_\lambda \) are in the gif on the top right. The cyan colored set is \(\mathfrak{s}_-(\mathsf{A}_\lambda)\),
		the "minus" copy of \( \mathsf{A}_\lambda\); while the orange one is \(\mathfrak{s}_+(\mathsf{A}_\lambda)\), the "plus" copy of \( \mathsf{A}_\lambda\).
		As you can see these attractors are symmetric with respect to center \(0\), and sometimes this point is not part of the attractor. You may also notice how the plus and minus copies
		can touch either at a point or segments, or overlap substantially (the yellow part). In the case the overlap is nonempty, it is easy to prove that \(\mathsf{A}_\lambda\) is connected
		(a little harder, but possible, to show locally connected). In the opposite case, the attractor is totally disconnected and, hence, homeomorphic to a Cantor set. It can be shown then that
		</p>
		<p>
	\(\mathcal{M}=\left\{ \lambda\in\mathbb{D}~|~\mathsf{A}_\lambda\text{ is connected} \right\}~\text{ and }~\mathcal{M}_0=\left\{\lambda\in\mathbb{D}~|~0\in\mathsf{A}_\lambda\right\}\).
		</p>
		<p>
		The two sets are not at all equal! <em>Notice the contrast with what happens with the Mandelbrot set.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
    These sets were first introduced by <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=793899">M.F. Barnsley
		and A.N. Harrington</a> in the mid 1980s. In 1988-1992 <a href="https://www.math.u-psud.fr/~bousch/">Bousch</a> proved that \(\mathcal{M}\) and \(\mathcal{M}_0\)
		are connected, and locally connected. In 2002, <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1912290">C. Bandt</a>
		proved the existence of a hole in \(\mathcal{M}\), and conjectured that there are in fact infinitely many. In 2014, <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=3719268">D. Calegari, S. Koch, and
		A. Walker</a> gave a positive answer to the conjecture, for both \(\mathcal{M}\) and \(\mathcal{M}_0\). Furthermore, they constructed infinite sequences of holes accumulating at certain parameters in \(\partial\mathcal{M}\).
		These are <em>buried points</em> of \(\partial\mathcal{M}\), i.e. not path accessible from the complement \(\mathbb{D}\setminus\mathcal{M}\).
		</p>
		<p>
    The question of classifying these connected components of \(\mathbb{D}\setminus\mathcal{M}\) is still open; however the results in my thesis, are a step in that direction.
    I concentrated on boundary parameters that are not buried. I gave sufficient conditions on \(\lambda\in\partial\mathcal{M}\) or \(\partial\mathcal{M}_0\) to guarantee it is accessible from \(\mathbb{D}\setminus\mathcal{M}\).
		Moreover, I showed that a parameters in \(\partial\mathcal{M}\) is accessible from the largest connected component of \(\mathbb{D}\setminus\mathcal{M}\) by directly constructing a path connecting it to \(0\).

    <p>Currently, I am working on extending these results using techniques from kneading theory and complex dynamics inspired by the work of <a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/video_archive/?play=2099">G. Tiozzo K. Lindsey</a> and
    <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ergodic-theory-and-dynamical-systems/article/quasisymmetric-conjugacy-between-quadratic-dynamics-and-iterated-function-systems/F7D829F84D00CEC3F3801D8BE1B06470">K.L. Ero&#287lu, S. Rohde, &amp B. Solomyak</a>.</p>

		The results appeared in three articles, two of which have been published in the <em>Pi Mu Epsilon journal</em> and <em>Fundamenta Mathematicae</em>, while the other is awaiting publication in <em>Topology Preceedings</em>.</p>
    <p>I presented this work at three conferences:
	<ul>
	<li>at the Symposium for Undergraduate in the Mathematical Sciences (SUMS) hosted by Brown University on March 2013,</li>
	<li>at the <a href="http://www.math.illinois.edu/mwds/">Midwest Dynamical System Conference</a> hosted by University Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on November 2013 (poster),</li>
	<li>at the <a href="http://at.yorku.ca/c/b/i/t/70.htm">48th Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference</a> hosted by University of Richmond on March 2014.
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>I have also participated in a Research Experience for Undergraduate (<a href="http://www.math.umn.edu/~scheel/reu/reu-opportunities.html">REU</a>) at University of Minnesota Twin Cities (<a href="http://www.math.umn.edu">UMN</a>).
	Here I worked under the guidance of <a href="http://www.math.umn.edu/~scheel/">Dr. Arnd Scheel</a> and his, at the time, postdoctoral student <a href="http://math.gmu.edu/~mholzer/">Dr. Matt Holzer</a>. The results appeared in the article

          <div class="abscontent" style="display:none"><p>This paper proposes a new category of electric motors able to generate high torque with reduced volume, i.e., high torque density. Such a new design is denominated as an airgapless electrical motor since the rotor touches the stator as it spins. Due to its zero airgap, the proposed motor will maximize the generated torque, allowing such type of motors to be competitive in applications where hydraulic motors are prevalent, i.e., low-speed and high-torque requirements. Unlike hydraulic motor systems that face two major problems with their braking system and also with low efficiency due to a large number of energy conversion stages (i.e., motor-pump, hydraulic connections and the hydraulic motor itself),
	the proposed electric motor converts electrical energy directly to mechanical energy with no extra braking system necessary and with higher efficiency. A proof-of-concept electric motor prototype along with its drive system is built to validate the theoretical assumptions proposed in this paper.</p></div> -<a href="files/Final_9Phase_V03.pdf">[preprint]</a> </li>

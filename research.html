			<h2>Research</h2> 
         	 <p>My research interests lie in complex dynamical systems, iterated function systems, symbolic dynamics,ergodic theory, and geometric group theory.</p>
			<p></p>
		<p>During my  studies at Boston University (<a class="bu" href="http://www.bu.edu/math" target="_blank"><span class="bu">BU</span></a>) I was working under the supervision of <a href="http://math.bu.edu/people/bob/">Dr. Robert L. Devaney</a>. The results appeared in three articles, two of which have been published in the <em>Pi Mu Epsilon journal</em> and <em>Fundamenta Mathematicae</em>, while the other is awaiting publication in <em>Topology Preceedings</em>.</p>
        <p>I presented this work at three conferences:
	<ul>
	<li>at the Symposium for Undergraduate in the Mathematical Sciences (SUMS) hosted by Brown University on March 2013,</li>
	<li>at the <a href="http://www.math.illinois.edu/mwds/">Midwest Dynamical System Conference</a> hosted by University Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on November 2013 (poster),</li>
	<li>at the <a href="http://at.yorku.ca/c/b/i/t/70.htm">48th Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference</a> hosted by University of Richmond on March 2014.
	</ul>
</p>    
	 <p>I also participated in a Research Experience for Undergraduate (<a href="http://www.math.umn.edu/~scheel/reu/reu-opportunities.html">REU</a>) at University of Minnesota Twin Cities (<a href="http://www.math.umn.edu">UMN</a>). Here I worked under the guidance of <a href="http://www.math.umn.edu/~scheel/">Dr. Arnd Scheel</a> and his, at the time, postdoctoral student <a href="http://math.gmu.edu/~mholzer/">Dr. Matt Holzer</a>. The results appeared in the article published in the <em>SIAM Undergraduate Research Online journal</em>.</p>

<div id="abs4", style='display:none'>This paper proposes a new category of electric motors able to generate high torque with reduced volume, i.e., high torque density. Such a new design is denominated as an airgapless electrical motor since the rotor touches the stator as it spins. Due to its zero airgap, the proposed motor will maximize the generated torque, allowing such type of motors to be competitive in applications where hydraulic motors are prevalent, i.e., low-speed and high-torque requirements. Unlike hydraulic motor systems that face two major problems with their braking system and also with low efficiency due to a large number of energy conversion stages (i.e., motor-pump, hydraulic connections and the hydraulic motor itself), the proposed electric motor converts electrical energy directly to mechanical energy with no extra braking system necessary and with higher efficiency. A proof-of-concept electric motor prototype along with its drive system is built to validate the theoretical assumptions proposed in this paper.</div></li>

<div id="abs4", style='display:none'>For the family of rational maps \(z^n + \lambda~/~z^n\) where \(n \geq 3 \), it is known that there are infinitely many copies of the Mandelbrot set that are buried in the paramenter plane, i.e., they do not extend to the outer boundary of this set. For parameters lying in the main cardioids of these Mandelbrot sets, the corresponding Julia sets are always Sierpi&#324ski curves, and so they are all homeomorphic to one another. However, it is known that only those cardioids that aresymmetrically located in the parameter plane have conjugate dynamics. We produce a dynamical invariant that explains why these maps have different dynamics.</div> -<a href="http://math.bu.edu/people/bob/papers/dyn-invt.pdf">preprint</a></li>

<div id="abs3", style='display:none'>In this paper we investigate the Julia sets of singularly perturbed complex rational maps of the form \(f(z) = z^n + \lambda~/~z^d\).

these cardioids are complex conjugates of one another.</div>  </li>

  -<a href="javascript:;" onclick="toggle_visibility('abs');">abstract</a>
<div id="abs1", style='display:none'>The purpose of this paper is to explore spatio-temporal pattern formation via invasion fronts in the
one and two dimensional Keller-Segel chemotaxis model. In the one-dimensional case, simulations show
that solutions that begin near an unstable equilibrium evolve into periodic patterns. These in turn evolve
into new patterns through a process known as coarsening. In the two-dimensional case, we encounter
only periodic patterns in the wake of the initial front. Transverse patterning only arises as a result of a
transverse instability of these periodic patterns from the leading invasion front.</div> -<a href="http://www.siam.org/students/siuro/vol6/S01200.pdf">pdf</a></li>

## Developer

During the pandemic I helped my brother [Luciano](https://lucianogsilvestri.github.io/) and the [Murillo Group](https://murillogroupmsu.com/) at Michigan State University build the website for their software: [SARKAS: Python MD code for plasma physics](https://murillo-group.github.io/sarkas). I used the static site generator Sphinx to design and build it. We went live on November 2021.

In mid September 2021 I enrolled in a 14(+3)-weeks bootcamp [EPICODE School](https://epicode.com) to learn about Full Stack development.

Currently, I am a software developer at [O-LAB](https://olab-studio.com) and I work as a sub-contractor with [SAS Italy](https://www.sas.com/it_it/home.html).

***More info to come soon... I hope...***
### Contribution to Open Source
Some of my free time I spend it in contributing to Open Source projects. In this way I hope to get more confident in my programming skills.

Here is a list of projects I have contributed:
- [Wagtail documentation](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/8759): translated some `.rst` pages to `.md`.
- [The Coding Train website](https://github.com/CodingTrain/thecodingtrain.com/pull/338): added the Track *Git an Github for poets*. 
- [sasctl](https://github.com/sassoftware/python-sasctl/pull/129): expanded usage for `cas_management` service.

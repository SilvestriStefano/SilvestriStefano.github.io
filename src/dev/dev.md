## Developer

During the pandemic I helped my brother [Luciano](https://lucianogsilvestri.github.io/) and the [Murillo Group](https://murillogroupmsu.com/) at Michigan State University build the website for their software: [SARKAS: Python MD code for plasma physics](https://sarkas.readthedocs.io). I used the static site generator Sphinx to design and build it. We went live on November 2021.

In mid September 2021 I enrolled in a 14(+3)-weeks bootcamp [EPICODE School](https://epicode.com) to learn about Full Stack development.

Currently, I am a software developer at [O-LAB](https://olab-studio.com) and I work as a solutions consultant with [SAS Italy](https://www.sas.com/it_it/home.html). My work often involves leveraging REST APIs, streamlining data analytics processes, and automating complex tasks. Of course, I make sure to document everything I develop whether or not it is required.

On the side, I am developing in Python some tools to help in my maths research. The [source code](https://github.com/silvestriStefano/coreEntropy_neighborIFS/) is available on GitHub. I am still not set on the name though, so it might change in the future *(if and)* when it is complete.

### Contributions to Open Source
I spend some of my free time contributing to Open Source projects. In this way I hope to get more confident in my programming skills.

Here is a list of my contributions with a link to the PRs:
- [Sarkas: Python MD code for plasma physics](https://github.com/murillo-group/sarkas/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ASilvestriStefano): builder/mantainer of the website, some code refactoring, and tests writer.
- [Wagtail documentation](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/8759): translated some `.rst` pages to `.md`.
- [The Coding Train website](https://github.com/CodingTrain/thecodingtrain.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ASilvestriStefano): added some Tracks. 
- [sasctl: Python package and CLI for integration with SAS Viya](https://github.com/sassoftware/python-sasctl/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ASilvestriStefano): some code and documentation updates. 
- [Pandas documentation](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ASilvestriStefano): a couple of minor CSS improvements on the documentation.

## Developer

During the pandemic I helped my brother [Luciano](https://lucianogsilvestri.github.io/) and the [Murillo Group](https://murillogroupmsu.com/) at Michigan State University build the website for their software: [SARKAS: Python MD code for plasma physics](https://murillo-group.github.io/sarkas). I used the static site generator Sphinx to design and build it. We went live on November 2021.

In mid September 2021 I enrolled in a 14(+3)-weeks bootcamp [EPICODE School](https://epicode.com) to learn about Full Stack development.

Currently, I am a software developer at [O-LAB](https://olab-studio.com) and I work as a sub-contractor with [SAS Italy](https://www.sas.com/it_it/home.html).

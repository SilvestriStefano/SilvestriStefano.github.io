While an undergraduate I had the opportunity to do some research both in pure and applied mathematics.


## Pure Maths at Boston University
I was working under the supervision of [Robert L. Devaney](https://math.bu.edu/people/bob/). We were interested in the topology and dynamics of the Julia sets created by the singular perturbations of the power maps $z^n$:
$$
F_\lambda(z)=z^n+\dfrac{\lambda}{z^d}\quad n\geq2, ~ d\geq1.
$$
These are often called *McMullen maps*. I mainly focused on the case $n = d = 2$, but also considered the more general case $n=d\geq3$ with the [Dynamical System group at BU](https://math.bu.edu/dynamics/).
<!-- The Julia sets behave in three different ways as \(\lambda\rightarrow 0\). In the case \(d=1\), the Julia set converges to the closed unit disk as \(\lambda\rightarrow 0\) along \(n-1\) special rays in \(\mathbb{C}\). For \(n=d=2\) the Julia set converges to the unit disk as \(\lambda\rightarrow 0\) from all directions in \(\mathbb{C}\), in other words it is a circle. In cases with \(n,d>2\), regardless of how small \(\lvert\lambda\rvert\) Julia sets no longer converge, as there is always an annulus of fixed size about the origin in the complement of the Julia set. -->

The results appeared in three articles, two of which have been published in the *Pi Mu Epsilon journal* and *Fundamenta Mathematicae*, while the other was supposed to appear in *Topology Preceedings* but never did.

I presented this work at three conferences:
- at the Symposium for Undergraduate in the Mathematical Sciences (SUMS) hosted by Brown University on March 2013,
- at the [Midwest Dynamical System Conference](https://www.math.illinois.edu/mwds/) hosted by University Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on November 2013 (poster),
- at the [48th Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference](https://at.yorku.ca/c/b/i/t/70.htm) hosted by University of Richmond on March 2014.

## Applied Maths at University of Minnesota Twin Cities
I have also participated in a Research Experience for Undergraduate ([REU](https://www.math.umn.edu/~scheel/reu/reu-opportunities.html)) at University of Minnesota Twin Cities ([UMN](https://www.math.umn.edu)). Here I worked under the guidance of [Arnd Scheel](https://www.math.umn.edu/~scheel/) and his, at the time, postdoctoral student [Matt Holzer](https://math.gmu.edu/~mholzer/) The results appeared in the article published in the *SIAM Undergraduate Research Online journal*.

I first thought of becoming a mathematician during my last year of highschool, thanks to a couple of special programs with [Rome's Third University](https://matematicafisica.uniroma3.it/terza-missione/per-la-scuola/). The thought then became a goal while an undergraduate at [Boston University](https://bu.edu) once [Professor R.L. Devaney](https://math.bu.edu/people/bob) agreed to supervise me on a research project.

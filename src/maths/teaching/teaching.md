***I firmly believe in [Federico Ardila](https://fardila.com/)'s basic axioms***

- **Axiom 1**: Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
- **Axiom 2**: Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
- **Axiom 3**: Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
- **Axiom 4**: Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.

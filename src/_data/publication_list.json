The set $\\mathcal{M}$ can also be characterized as the locus of parameters for which the attractor of the IFS $\\{1+\\lambda z, \\lambda z, -1+\\lambda z\\}$ contains $\\lambda^{-1}$. Exploiting the asymptotic similarity of $\\mathcal{M}$ and $\\mathcal{M}_0$ with the respective associated attractors, we give sufficient conditions on $\\lambda\\in\\partial\\mathcal{M}$ or $\\partial\\mathcal{M}_0$ to guarantee it is path accessible from the complement $\\mathbb{D}\\setminus\\mathcal{M}$.",

        "abstract":"This paper proposes a new category of electric motors able to generate high torque with reduced volume, i.e., high torque density. Such a new design is denominated as an airgapless electrical motor since the rotor touches the stator as it spins. Due to its zero airgap, the proposed motor will maximize the generated torque, allowing such type of motors to be competitive in applications where hydraulic motors are prevalent, i.e., low-speed and high-torque requirements. Unlike hydraulic motor systems that face two major problems with their braking system and also with low efficiency due to a large number of energy conversion stages (i.e., motor-pump, hydraulic connections and the hydraulic motor itself), the proposed electric motor converts electrical energy directly to mechanical energy with no extra braking system necessary and with higher efficiency. A proof-of-concept electric motor prototype along with its drive system is built to validate the theoretical assumptions proposed in this paper.",

For parameters lying in the main cardioids of these Mandelbrot sets, the corresponding Julia sets are always Sierpi&#324;ski curves, and so they are all homeomorphic to one another. However, it is known that only those cardioids that are symmetrically located in the parameter plane have conjugate dynamics. We produce a dynamical invariant that explains why these maps have different dynamics.",

In the one-dimensional case, simulations show that solutions that begin near an unstable equilibrium evolve into periodic patterns. These in turn evolve into new patterns through a process known as coarsening. In the two-dimensional case, we encounter only periodic patterns in the wake of the initial front. Transverse patterning only arises as a result of a transverse instability of these periodic patterns from the leading invasion front.",
